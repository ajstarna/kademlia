- test framework for running multiple nodes.
    - Could this include some unit tests with two protocol managers? Mock sockets right?
        - actually maybe just two DHTs as implemented in the above TODO
    - then some larger integration tests that actually spin up separate nodes and run through some cases.
    - we could run a bunch of "headless"


- the DHT class should use actual errors types since user facing
