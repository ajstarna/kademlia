- things missing as described in the paper:
    Protocol:
    - optional "ping piggy back"
    - nodes that fail to respond during a lookup process are removed until they respond

    Routing Table:
    - special rule about sometimes keeping more than k contacts (see routing paper section for details)

    Key, Value republishing:
    - there is a whole big section on this

- some dht implementations use a replacement cache per bucket

- the DHT class should use actual errors types since user facing

- how to test at scale and in a real network setting?
   - if we mock udp we could test large scale locally. simulate a network with flakiness
   - measure how many hops lookups are usually taking
   - add ways to debug which nodes are holding which values
