- add a binary (main.rs?) with a simple clap CLI to run a headless node.
    - It should be able to be one of the bootstrap nodes, or it can join an existing network.

- add logging to help see whats happening.

- bucket refresh

- make sure we are removing dead nodes properly when they don't respond or other

- the DHT class should use actual errors types since user facing

- how to test at scale and in a real network setting?
   - even some manual testing with the binary?
   - if we mock udp we could test large scale locally. simulate a network with flakiness
