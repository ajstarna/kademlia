- improve/more logs?

- things missing as described in the paper:
    Protocol:
    - echo RPC random ID to help with address forgery
    - optional "ping piggy back"
    - nodes that fail to respond during a lookup process are removed until they respond
    - for caching purposes, once a value lookup suceeds, the requesting node stores the (k, v)
      at the closest node it observed to the key that did not return the value.
        - To avoid over caching, inversely proportional TTL (see paper for details)
    - each node refreshes any bucket to which it has not performed a node lookup in the past hour.
        - refreshing means picking a random ID in the bucket's range and performing a node search for that ID.
    - when a node enters the network, it lookups itself (which I already coded), but then it needs to refresh
      all k-buckets further away than its closest neighbour (whats the neighbour? a bucket? a node?)

    Routing Table:
    - special rule about sometimes keeping more than k contacts (see routing paper section for details)

    Key, Value republishing:
    - there is a whole big section on this

- the DHT class should use actual errors types since user facing

- how to test at scale and in a real network setting?
   - if we mock udp we could test large scale locally. simulate a network with flakiness

- test with someone across the internet
